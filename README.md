## Ear Trainer

This web application has been developed for ear training. Intervals are played, which then have to be identified by ear.

A piano sound is artificially generated using [additive sound synthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_synthesis) and [envelopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Envelope_(music)). The application is implemented with *Vue.js* and the *Mozilla Web Audio API*.

The application can be run [here](https://feberts.github.io/ear-trainer/).
